## 2026-01-16: Set up Go project with basic HTTP server

### Completed
- Created go.mod with module github.com/ralphy/taskserver (Go 1.21)
- Created main.go with:
  - Task struct with ID, Title, Description, Completed, and CreatedAt fields
  - TaskStore for thread-safe in-memory storage using sync.RWMutex
  - Server struct with HTTP handlers for all CRUD operations
  - Routes: GET/POST /tasks and GET/DELETE /tasks/{id}
  - Proper Content-Type headers (application/json)
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 405, 500)
- Created main_test.go with comprehensive tests:
  - TaskStore unit tests (Create, Get, GetAll, Delete)
  - Server integration tests for all endpoints
  - Error handling tests (invalid JSON, missing title, 404s, method not allowed)

### Test Results
All 18 tests passing.

### Completed
- Verified GET /tasks/{id} endpoint implementation in main.go (getTask method, lines 153-163)
- Endpoint extracts task ID from URL path and returns single task as JSON
- Returns 200 OK with task data when found
- Returns 404 Not Found with error JSON when task doesn't exist
- Confirmed existing tests cover this endpoint (TestServerGetTaskByID with 2 test cases)
- All 18 tests passing

- Marked task as complete in PRD.md

## 2026-01-16: Mark DELETE /tasks/{id} endpoint as complete

### Completed
- Verified DELETE /tasks/{id} endpoint implementation in main.go (deleteTask method, lines 166-173)
- Endpoint extracts task ID from URL path and deletes the task from the store
- Returns 204 No Content on successful deletion
- Returns 404 Not Found with error JSON when task doesn't exist
- Confirmed existing tests cover this endpoint (TestServerDeleteTask with 2 test cases)
- All 18 tests passing
- Linting passes (go vet, gofmt)
- Marked task as complete in PRD.md

### All PRD Tasks Complete
All 5 tasks in the PRD have been implemented and verified.

## 2026-01-16: Re-implement Go project setup

### Completed
- Recreated go.mod with module github.com/ralphy/taskserver (Go 1.21)
- Recreated main.go with:
  - Task struct with ID, Title, Description, Completed, and CreatedAt fields
  - TaskStore for thread-safe in-memory storage using sync.RWMutex
  - Server struct implementing http.Handler with routing for all endpoints
  - Routes: GET/POST /tasks and GET/DELETE /tasks/{id}
  - Proper Content-Type headers (application/json)
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 405)
